A long time ago, on a page not that far away. We have an old webpage that held some photos from old adventures [here](https://ouradventuresphotography.github.io). The webpage still works for the most part and looks great, but takes way too long to maintain and update. So instead you’ll be able to view all of our new adventures here in blog style. If you don’t like it sorry, not sorry.

Take some time to check the old [page](https://ouradventuresphotography.github.io) out! It has some amazing pictures, mostly taken by Alexis that I might upload here given the time.

Later,

Justin
