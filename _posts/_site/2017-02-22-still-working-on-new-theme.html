<p>Just to keep you updated I am working on a better theme for this webpage. I am struggling to get the page to run on Github pages for whatever reason, but it does run smoothly locally using ‘$ bundle exec jekyll serve’. Hopefully I will find a solution and push out the new theme soon!</p>

<p>Anyhow, here is a picture of the view from our campsite over presidents day weekend, it was an amazing time and I can not wait to go again:</p>
